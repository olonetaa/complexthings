Noncoding RNA:

Only 1%-2% of the human DNA sequence are genes that encode proteins.
But 75% of DNA is transcribed into RNAs
Noncoding RNA can be involved in gene regulation:
X-inactivation (XIST gene is transcribed and the RNA wraps around the inactivated X chromosome)
Acting as RNA scaffolds to RNA-binding proteins
microRNA: upstream regulators (miRNA)
E.g. lin-4 and let-7 in C. elegans → controls morphology
Let-7 has nearly identical genes in vertebrates and other classes of animals (ancient)
How do microRNAs work? (main way they work):
pre-miRNA is transcribed (several miRNA stuck together)
Dicer protein chops it up
miRNAs bond with Argonaute proteins, forms RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
miRNAs guide RISC to mRNA (one miRNA typically has a sequence compatible with lots of mRNAs, we don’t know how they manage to be selective)
Stops its transcription or degrades it
What do they control?
Cell fate, cell cycle, apoptosis (important stuff!)
