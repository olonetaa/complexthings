I made a tree graph that shows how fields of biology (except for some of the 'fundamentals') depend on one another. Basically, I asked myself: what do you wish you know completely when you are studying this? 

For example, learning respiration and photosynthesis would have been so much easier if I learned thermodynamics beforehand, so I could understand better the energy transfer that took place. Unfortunately, I taught myself these topics using only Campbell Biology (a great general biology book, by the way). It skimmed through the chemistry prerequisites, and since I was preparing for the Biology Olympiad, I didn't have time to go back and learn the chemistry. This is one of the pains of self-learning: you always find that you have to go back and learn some prerequisite you did not know.

- The fields are in bold.
- Below are either summaries of the field or questions I have or had about the field
- The blue text is just my thoughts about what to explore further.
