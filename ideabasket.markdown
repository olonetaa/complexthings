## Ideabasket

Here is where I store my ideas and questions that would be turned into posts.

Questions:

- Why does maple trees have sugar-rich saps?
- Is the Gaia hypothesis a metaphor styled in a fancy way, or is it a real scientific hypothesis?


Notes:

- "Endless Forms Most Beautiful" by Sean B. Carroll
- "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins
- ["A slow-fast trait continuum at the whole community level in relation to land-useintensiÔ¨Åcation" (Neyret et al.)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45113-5)
