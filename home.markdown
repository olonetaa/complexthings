## Hi! 

I'm Lila and I'm a Grade 11 student starting the IB program. I'm a biology nerd and I stumble into internet rabbitholes a lot, trying to research interesting bits of biology I've read or observed. I post my (relatively) finished research notes on this site for any curious people (humans, elves, dwarrow or gentlehobbit).
