## I'm Lila. Hi!

### What's this site for?

I like to research cool biology observations and ideas (mine or others') online, and I often dig deep into research papers and books. 

So I'll post my research notes here on this site to share with everyone, because if I don't make a project out of this hobby, I lose my notes or never write them. 

Sometimes I give up because the papers are too hard, but I'll still put the incomplete notes up here.

### "Complex things"? 

It comes from this quote:

>Biology is the study of complex things that appear to have been designed for a purpose. --Richard Dawkins

(It's not.)

### Who am I?

I'm 16, and I'm starting the IBDP program in August. I live in Singapore, a tiny, humid tropical island located on the Sunda shelf and not too far from the famous Wallace line. 

I like to observe interesting biological phenomena when I'm outdoors, like growth patterns of moss and lichen. I'm also a newbie birder (40-something birds in my life list). When I'm free, I surf Wikipedia or pretend I'm travelling by going on Google Maps.

I enjoy watching the show 'Bluey', and Lila isn't my real name - I borrowed it from the 'Bluey' character I resonate with the most. I also love J.R.R Tolkien's books.
