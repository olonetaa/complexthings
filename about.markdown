## I'm Lila. Hi!

#### What's this site for?

- I like to research cool biology observations and ideas (mine or others') online, and I often dig deep into research papers and books. 
- So I'll post my research notes here on this site to share with everyone, because if I don't make a project out of this hobby, I lose my notes or never write them. 
- Sometimes I give up because the papers are too hard[1], but I'll still put the incomplete notes up here.

#### Who am I?

I'm 16, and I'm starting the IBDP program in August. I live in Singapore, a tiny, humid tropical island located on the Sunda shelf and not too far from the famous Wallace line. 

I like to observe interesting biological phenomena when I'm outdoors, like growth patterns of moss and lichen[2]. I'm also a newbie birder (40-something birds in my life list). When I'm free, I surf Wikipedia[3] or pretend I'm travelling by going on Google Maps.

I enjoy watching the show 'Bluey', and Lila isn't my real name - I borrowed it from the 'Bluey' character I resonate with the most. I also love J.R.R Tolkien's books.


[1] It's mostly the statistics. It's my weakest math subject.
[2]in Singapore, you can scrape a bucket of moss from one tree. That's how humid it is. We've got clean air though, really can't complain.
[3] My absolute favorite website. I once read all the entries between and including "Peter the Great" to "Volga German Soviet Autonomous Republic". I'm a nerd, ok?
