### What's this site for?

I like researching cool biology observations and ideas online, diving deep into research papers and books. I'll post my research notes here to share with everyone, since I will certainly lose my notes or never write them if I don't. Sometimes the papers are too hard, but I'll still share my incomplete notes.

### "Complex things"? 

It comes from this quote:

>Biology is the study of complex things that appear to have been designed for a purpose. --Richard Dawkins

### Who am I?

I'm Riley, and I'm starting the IBDP program in August. I live in Singapore, a tiny, humid tropical island located on the Sunda shelf and not too far from the famous Wallace line. 

I like to observe interesting biological phenomena when I'm outdoors, and I'm also a newbie birder (40-something birds in my life list). When I'm free, I surf Wikipedia or pretend I'm travelling by going on Google Maps.
