### What's this site for?

I like researching biology observations and ideas online, and I'll post my research notes here to share with everyone, since I will certainly lose my notes or never write them if I don't. I might also post short essays on Tolkien's legendarium (I'm a fan) and books in general. 

### "Complex things"? 

It comes from this quote:

>Biology is the study of complex things that appear to have been designed for a purpose. --Richard Dawkins

### Who am I?

I'm Olonetaa, and I'm starting the IBDP program in August. I live in Singapore, a tiny, humid tropical island located on the Sunda shelf and not too far from the Wallace line. 

I like to observe interesting biological phenomena when I'm outdoors, and I'm also a newbie birder (40-something birds in my life list). When I'm free, I surf Wikipedia, pretend I'm travelling by going on Google Maps, or tell friends about obsure facts excitedly.
